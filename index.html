        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am Sami Dizon, your student in CIS 162. Blatant copying aside, I'm a returning student who's been at it for a year now. I started off pursuing computer science as a course but got hired partway through. Covid happened and I got laid off but that gave me the opportunity to continue my studies. My experiences at work convinced me to pursue accounting instead. I didn't want to waste my credits in CIS though so I'm making the most out of them by finishing the associates as well.</p>
            <p>My favorite site is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> because I can take a quick peek once a day to get a hold on the current events both in internet culture and global events.</p>
        <h2>When I have free time</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>I drive around aimlessly towards points of interest</li>
                <li>Stay indoors consuming media</li>
                <li>Build small form factor PCs</li>
            </ol>
